Here is the list of parts needed:
1. 5V Power supply
2. 3V Power supply, for both of these I used the YwRobot545043 power source device
3. Arduino DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
4. MQ135 Gas quality sensor
5. PIR motion sensor
6. Liquid surface height water level sensor
7. NodeMCU ESP8266 micro-controller
8. Jumper cables and wires, male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-female
9. Breadboards
10. 100k ohms variable resistor
11. 1M ohms variable resistor
12. 2 of 2N7000 transistor
13. 2 of 10k ohms resistors
14. 4 LEDs
Note: The NodeMCU only has 1 analog input pin and we need 2, so we can multiplex the sensors, by triggering one sensor at a time,
using the digital output pins to provide power to the sensor when needed. When one sensor reading is obtained, turn the related
digital output pin of the nodemcu off, and trigger the pin connected to the next analog sensor needed. For now this is done for 
the gas and water level sensors only as they are the only ones giving analog outputs.
The NodeMCU cannot give 5V in its digital output pins so use the transistor and 10k resistors to build 2 small sub-circuits to
rais the voltage level of the digital outputs from 3.3V to 5V so that the 5V analog sensors can be triggered.
